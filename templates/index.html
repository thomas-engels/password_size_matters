                            <p>First, you must first understand the two characteristics of a password: the allowable
                                characters
                                (^%$[.üîã#AzrR5‚ù§Ô∏èüíé...) and your chosen length (8 to 20 typically).
                                Together these characteristics determine the difficulty of cracking the password. More
                                allowable characters, harder to crack. Longer password, extremely hard to crack! Why?
                                Simply raise the number of allowable characters to the power of the password length to
                                determine the number of possible passwords... you'll need a calculator for these massive numbers.
                                Or you can use my calculator and table below!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Secondly, you must understand what companies and websites do after you create your
                                password. If they're a quality service, they likely transform your password using a complex, deterministic,
                                "one-way" function that results in a 64-character list of seemingly random numbers and
                                letters. This long random string is called the password hash, which is then stored on the company's servers.
                                In fact, they should never know your plain-text password, only your password hash.

                                Let's assume your favorite company just suffered a major data breach (e.g., TicketMaster
                                in June 2024) and the hackers stole millions of users password hashes.
                                The hackers have two choices now: sell the password hashes on the dark web or start
                                doing lots of math. By "Math", I'm referring to hackers generating millions and
                                millions of password hashes with the hope of finding a match from the data breach's
                                hashes.
                                If a match is found, then the hacker simply looks at what plain-text password generated
                                the matching hash and boom--password cracked!
                                This is "Password Cracking": generating password hashes and discovering matches from the
                                data breach.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After finding a match, the hacker's computer program will attempt to log in to hundreds
                                of websites using with your username and password.
                                If they successfully log in to a website, you've officially been hacked. And if you
                                re-used that password, well you just made the hacker extra happy.
                                Don't reuse any passwords.
                            <p>
                                In many cases, the hackers will prioritize generating hashes for the minimum password
                                requirement types; e.g., TicketMaster requires an 8-character password
                                containing at least 1 number and 1 letter. If you're a normal person, your passwords
                                likely do not exceed these minimum requirements
                                because it's convenient. Given the time and cost to generate hashes, hackers
                                thus may only focus on these minimum requirements when generating their hashes.
                                If TicketMaster is using one of the most secure password encryption algorithms (bcrypt),
                                it will take roughly 12 days to generate EVERY password hash with less than $2M.
                                If TickerMaster is using a less secure, yet common encryption algorithm (MD5), it will
                                take less than 1 second to generate EVERY password hash for less than $2K.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a TicketMaster customer, should I be concerned? This depends on the length of my
                                password. If my password is 8 characters, yes I should be concerned and need to reset my
                                password.
                                If my password is long (15 to 20 characters), I could reset my password to be extra
                                careful but cracking my password will take forever so the hackers won't even bother.

                                So what's the takeaway? Long passwords (15-20) and NEVER re-using them will make you
                                highly resilient to hackers. Cracking such a long password simply isn't worth the hacker's time and money.
                                And even if they manage to crack it, their access will be limited to a single service.
